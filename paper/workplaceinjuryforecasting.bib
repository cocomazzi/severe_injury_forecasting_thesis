	abstract = {This survey paper explores the application of machine learning (ML) techniques in the domain of workplace injuries, focusing on three key areas: risk prediction, return to work (RTW) strategies, and demographic analysis. Through an extensive review of literature from January 2015 to July 2024, this paper examines the latest advancements in ML-driven approaches to workplace safety and identifies important research gaps. This paper highlights how classical ML techniques, such as ensemble models and decision trees, have become essential tools for identifying workplace injury risks, enabling more accurate interventions. It emphasizes the importance of leveraging ML in personalized RTW programs, which use data-driven insights to improve recovery outcomes and reduce economic demands. In the context of demographic analysis, this paper explores how ML algorithms can uncover disparities in injury rates across various age groups, industries, and occupations, underscoring the need for targeted safety measures. Moreover, research gaps are identified, particularly regarding the emerging potential of advanced ML techniques, such as deep learning and large language models (LLMs), for analyzing structured and unstructured safety data, methods that have not yet been widely applied in workplace injury research. As such, future research should apply recent advances in ML, integrating these approaches with comprehensive and accessible datasets to enhance the prediction and prevention of workplace injuries, provide more detailed analytics and insights, and improve safety protocols across all industries. This comprehensive survey is an invaluable resource for researchers and practitioners leveraging ML to address complex challenges in workplace safety.},

	abstract = {Millions of US workers are seriously injured on the job annually. These injuries have a significant and deleterious impact on injured workers, their families, and their communities. The limitations of the historical work injury surveillance systems have constrained research into the distribution and determinants of work injuries and efforts to improve allocation of limited injury prevention resources. Most work injury data sets suffer from significant limitations and fail to include a sizable proportion of work injuries.  In recent years, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has begun to collect and make available to the public more detailed data on work injuries at thousands of high hazard establishments. These data sets provide the opportunity to greatly improve our work injury surveillance system. Researchers are now using these data to investigate and compare injury risk in industries and high-hazard firms where workers are at increased risk of musculoskeletal disorders. However, these rich data sets are underused.  Maintaining and facilitating access to accurate, current data can contribute to improved prevention of work-related injuries and deaths.

We employ machine learning (ML) techniques and a comprehensive panel dataset from Italy to detect systematic patterns that pinpoint areas most at risk of onthe-job fatalities. The empirical analysis demonstrates that ML algorithms can accurately forecast, ex-ante, the number of workplace deaths out of sample. We then create a granular risk map based on the ML forecasts and compare it with the actual allocation of on-site work inspections and public subsidies to improve occupational safety, finding minimal overlap. This mismatch suggests that public effort is currently not more prevalent where it is most needed, at least with respect to onthe-job deaths. Lastly, we assess the impact of on-site inspections on the number of workplace deaths via double/debiased machine learning and show that inspections appear to be effective only in areas flagged as high risk by the ML forecasts. Overall, these findings suggest that by replacing current allocation rules with machine predictions, it would be possible to significantly improve the cost-effectiveness of public interventions and boost the deployment of deterrent and preventive measures aimed at enhancing occupational safety and health.},

The use of machine learning is theoretically valuable to assist the predictive analysis, thus, this study attempts to propose a feature-optimized predictive model for anticipating occupational injury severity. A public database of 66,405 occupational injury records from OSHA is analyzed using five sets of machine learning models: Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. For model comparison, Random Forest outperformed other models with higher accuracy and F1-score. Therefore, it highlighted the potential of ensemble learning as a more accurate prediction model in the field of occupational injury. In constructing the model, this study also proposed the feature optimization technique that revealed the three most important features; ‘nature of injury’, ‘type of event’, and ‘affected body part’ in developing model. The accuracy of the Random Forest model was improved by 0.5\% or 0.895 and 0.954 for the prediction of hospitalization and amputation, respectively by redeveloping and optimizing the model with hyperparameter tuning. The feature optimization is essential in providing insight knowledge to the Safety and Health Practitioners for future injury corrective and preventive strategies.

This study examined the OSHA severe injury reports (SIRs) public microdata to understand time-related trends and patterns. Methods: This study included all SIRs from January 2015 to December 2021 (84 months). We employed time series decomposition models (classical additive and multiplicative, X-11, and X-13ARIMA-SEATS) to evaluate monthly seasonal effect and seasonally adjusted trend of SIRs. We developed data visuals to display trends from different models with the original data series. We compared number of daily SIRs by day of the week, and yearly trends by 2-digit NAICS and separately by 1-digit OIICS injury event. Results: There were a total of 70,241 SIRs in this 7 year period; ranging from 8,704 to 11,156 per year, and 600 to 1,100 per month. Seasonally adjusted trend indicated a gradual increase of SIRs over time until October 2018, then a steeper decrease until August 2020, and staying somewhat flat for the rest of the months. Seasonality indicated more SIRs were reported in the summer months (June, July, August). Daily SIRs indicated a weekday average of 34 (SD = 9) and weekend average of 11 (SD = 5). The Manufacturing and Construction industries reported the highest yearly SIRs. Contact with objects and equipment, and falls, slips, trips were the most numerous injury events associated with SIRs. Discussion: Although Federal OSHA SIR data do not include SIRs from state-plan jurisdictions, the data provide a timely national trend of SIR. This is the first known time series analysis of SIRs. Practical Applications: The findings of this study highlight the ability of researchers to use the SIRs as a timely indicator to understand occupational injury trends by specific industries and injury events.},

	abstract = {Forecasting groups of time series is of increasing practical importance, e.g. forecasting the demand for multiple products offered by a retailer or server loads within a data center. The local approach to this problem considers each time series separately and fits a function or model to each series. The global approach fits a single function to all series. For groups of similar time series, global methods outperform the more established local methods. However, recent results show good performance of global models even in heterogeneous datasets. This suggests a more general applicability of global methods, potentially leading to more accurate tools and new scenarios to study. Formalizing the setting of forecasting a set of time series with local and global methods, we provide the following contributions: 1) Global methods are not more restrictive than local methods, both can produce the same forecasts without any assumptions about similarity of the series. Global models can succeed in a wider range of problems than previously thought. 2) Basic generalization bounds for local and global algorithms. The complexity of local methods grows with the size of the set while it remains constant for global methods. In large datasets, a global algorithm can afford to be quite complex and still benefit from better generalization. These bounds serve to clarify and support recent experimental results in the field, and guide the design of new algorithms. For the class of autoregressive models, this implies that global models can have much larger memory than local methods. 3) In an extensive empirical study, purposely naive algorithms derived from these principles, such as global linear models or deep networks result in superior accuracy. In particular, global linear models can provide competitive accuracy with two orders of magnitude fewer parameters than local methods.},

	abstract = {We propose a generic framework for short-term occupational accident forecasting that leverages safety inspections and models accident occurrences as binary time series. The approach generates daily predictions, which are then aggregated into weekly safety assessments to better inform decision making. To ensure the reliability and operational applicability of the forecasts, we apply a sliding-window cross-validation procedure specifically designed for time series data, combined with an evaluation based on aggregated period-level metrics. Several machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, tree-based models, and neural networks, are trained and systematically compared within this framework. Unlike the other approaches, the long short-term memory (LSTM) network outperforms the other approaches and detects the upcoming high-risk periods with a balanced accuracy of 0.86, confirming the robustness of our methodology and demonstrating that a binary time series model can anticipate these critical periods based on safety inspections. The proposed methodology converts routine safety inspection data into clear weekly risk scores, detecting the periods when accidents are most likely. Decision-makers can integrate these scores into their planning tools to classify inspection priorities, schedule targeted interventions, and funnel resources to the sites or shifts classified as highest risk, stepping in before incidents occur and getting the greatest return on safety investments.},

This paper applies a variety of machine-learning methods to the Boston housing dataset, an iconic proving ground for machine learning. Though machine learning often lacks the overt interpretability of linear regression, methods based on decision trees score the relative importance of dataset features. In addition to addressing the theoretical tradeoff between bias and variance, this paper discusses practices rarely followed in traditional economics: the splitting of data into training, validation, and test sets; the scaling of data; and the preference for retaining all data. The choice between traditional and machine-learning methods hinges on practical rather than mathematical considerations. In settings emphasizing interpretative clarity through the scale and sign of regression coefficients, machine learning may best play an ancillary role. Wherever predictive accuracy is paramount, however, or where heteroskedasticity or high dimensionality might impair the clarity of linear methods, machine learning can deliver superior results.},

We obtain oracle inequalities for the pooled and ﬁxed eﬀects sparse-group LASSO panel data estimators recognizing that ﬁnancial and economic data exhibit heavier than Gaussian tails. To that end, we leverage on a novel Fuk-Nagaev concentration inequality for panel data consisting of heavy-tailed τ -mixing processes which may be of independent interest in other high-dimensional panel data settings.},

We assess the proposed architecture on a load data set provided by the Global Energy Forecasting Competition. The conclusion is that it outperforms other machine learning forecasting techniques as well as time-series analysis methods.},

	abstract = {The recent advances in Big Data have opened up the opportunity to develop competitive Global Forecasting Models (GFM) that simultaneously learn from many time series. Although, the concept of series relatedness has been heavily exploited with GFMs to explain their superiority over local statistical benchmarks, this concept remains largely under-investigated in an empirical setting. Hence, this study attempts to explore the factors that affect GFM performance, by simulating a number of datasets having controllable characteristics. The factors being controlled are along the homogeneity/heterogeneity of series, the complexity of patterns in the series, the complexity of forecasting models, and the lengths/number of series. We simulate time series from simple Data Generating Processes (DGP), such as Auto Regressive (AR), Seasonal AR and Fourier Terms to complex DGPs, such as Chaotic Logistic Map, Self-Exciting Threshold Auto-Regressive and Mackey-Glass Equations. We perform experiments on these datasets using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Feed-Forward Neural Networks, Pooled Regression models and Light Gradient Boosting Models (LGBM) built as GFMs, and compare their performance against standard statistical forecasting techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that with respect to GFM performance, relatedness is closely associated with other factors such as the availability of data, complexity of data and the complexity of the forecasting technique used. Also, techniques such as RNNs and LGBMs having complex non-linear modelling capabilities, when built as GFMs are competitive methods under challenging forecasting scenarios such as short series, heterogeneous series and having minimal prior knowledge of the data patterns.},

Several approaches that deal with this complex problem have been proposed in the literature but an extensive comparison on a large number of tasks is still missing. This paper aims to fill this gap by reviewing existing strategies for multi-step ahead forecasting and comparing them in theoretical and practical terms. To attain such an objective, we performed a large scale comparison of these different strategies using a large experimental benchmark (namely the 111 series from the NN5 forecasting competition). In addition, we considered the effects of deseasonalization, input variable selection, and forecast combination on these strategies and on multi-step ahead forecasting at large. The following three findings appear to be consistently supported by the experimental results: Multiple-Output strategies are the best performing approaches, deseasonalization leads to uniformly improved forecast accuracy, and input selection is more effective when performed in conjunction with deseasonalization.},

	abstract = {Accurate and reliable predictions of infectious disease dynamics can be valuable to public health organizations that plan interventions to decrease or prevent disease transmission. A great variety of models have been developed for this task, using different model structures, covariates, and targets for prediction. Experience has shown that the performance of these models varies; some tend to do better or worse in different seasons or at different points within a season. Ensemble methods combine multiple models to obtain a single prediction that leverages the strengths of each model. We considered a range of ensemble methods that each form a predictive density for a target of interest as a weighted sum of the predictive densities from component models. In the simplest case, equal weight is assigned to each component model; in the most complex case, the weights vary with the region, prediction target, week of the season when the predictions are made, a measure of component model uncertainty, and recent observations of disease incidence. We applied these methods to predict measures of influenza season timing and severity in the United States, both at the national and regional levels, using three component models. We trained the models on retrospective predictions from 14 seasons (1997/1998 - 2010/2011) and evaluated each model's prospective, out-of-sample performance in the five subsequent influenza seasons. In this test phase, the ensemble methods showed overall performance that was similar to the best of the component models, but offered more consistent performance across seasons than the component models. Ensemble methods offer the potential to deliver more reliable predictions to public health decision makers.},

	abstract = {Accurate prediction of the size and timing of infectious disease outbreaks could help public health officials in planning an appropriate response. This paper compares approaches developed by five different research groups to forecast seasonal influenza outbreaks in real time in the United States. Many of the models show more accurate forecasts than a historical baseline. A major impediment to predictive ability was the real-time accuracy of available data. The field of infectious disease forecasting is in its infancy and we expect that innovation will spur improvements in forecasting in the coming years., Influenza infects an estimated 9–35 million individuals each year in the United States and is a contributing cause for between 12,000 and 56,000 deaths annually. Seasonal outbreaks of influenza are common in temperate regions of the world, with highest incidence typically occurring in colder and drier months of the year. Real-time forecasts of influenza transmission can inform public health response to outbreaks. We present the results of a multiinstitution collaborative effort to standardize the collection and evaluation of forecasting models for influenza in the United States for the 2010/2011 through 2016/2017 influenza seasons. For these seven seasons, we assembled weekly real-time forecasts of seven targets of public health interest from 22 different models. We compared forecast accuracy of each model relative to a historical baseline seasonal average. Across all regions of the United States, over half of the models showed consistently better performance than the historical baseline when forecasting incidence of influenza-like illness 1 wk, 2 wk, and 3 wk ahead of available data and when forecasting the timing and magnitude of the seasonal peak. In some regions, delays in data reporting were strongly and negatively associated with forecast accuracy. More timely reporting and an improved overall accessibility to novel and traditional data sources are needed to improve forecasting accuracy and its integration with real-time public health decision making.},

	abstract = {We propose a generic framework for short-term occupational accident forecasting that leverages safety inspections and models accident occurrences as binary time series. The approach generates daily predictions, which are then aggregated into weekly safety assessments to better inform decision making. To ensure the reliability and operational applicability of the forecasts, we apply a sliding-window cross-validation procedure specifically designed for time series data, combined with an evaluation based on aggregated period-level metrics. Several machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, tree-based models, and neural networks, are trained and systematically compared within this framework. Unlike the other approaches, the long short-term memory (LSTM) network outperforms the other approaches and detects the upcoming high-risk periods with a balanced accuracy of 0.86, confirming the robustness of our methodology and demonstrating that a binary time series model can anticipate these critical periods based on safety inspections. The proposed methodology converts routine safety inspection data into clear weekly risk scores, detecting the periods when accidents are most likely. Decision-makers can integrate these scores into their planning tools to classify inspection priorities, schedule targeted interventions, and funnel resources to the sites or shifts classified as highest risk, stepping in before incidents occur and getting the greatest return on safety investments.},

	abstract = {Temporal aggregation (TA) refers to transforming a time series from higher to lower frequencies (e.g. monthly to quarterly). There are two different types of aggregation: overlapping and non-overlapping; which, when added to the option of using original time series, present the forecaster with three approaches to produce required forecasts over the lead-time period: (i) non-overlapping aggregation (NOA) (ii) overlapping aggregation (OA); and (iii) bottom-up to aggregate forecast (BU). Forecasters may then need to decide which approach to use or alternatively combine the forecasts generated by the three approaches, instead. In this study, we design and execute an experiment using the M4 competition dataset, to explore the effect of different initial frequencies (i.e. daily, monthly, and quarterly), data aggregation levels and combination methods on forecast accuracy. We are surprised to find that neither temporal aggregation strategies have an overall gain on forecasting accuracy. Equally concerning is the fact that straight (average) combinations of these forecasts are similarly of no benefit to the accuracy. To extract the benefits of both well-supported individual forecasting practices of temporal aggregation and combination, we propose a framework that aims to combine temporal aggregation and forecasting combinations using a polynomially weighted average with multiple learning rates. We find considerable overall improvement in forecasting accuracy by using the proposed combination, especially for longer lead-times. We discuss areas where the framework is expected to perform best in the future and conclude that further research is required in this area. We note that our method can work in parallel of others and close with an agenda for further research on forecasting by temporal aggregation.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Millions of workers are injured on the job each year. Updated injury reporting regulations from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in 2014 have resulted in publicly available data on reported severe injuries. Methods: OSHA severe injury reports (SIRs) were analyzed from 2015 to 2022. Severe injury rates were calculated using total employment estimates by industry and state to characterize the distribution of SIRs. Secondary analyses examined how SIRs differed seasonally, as well as before and after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: There were 83,338 severe workplace injuries reported across the 29 states that are under federal OSHA coverage. Manufacturing (375.98 per 100,000 workers) and Utilities (277.21 per 100,000 workers) had the highest rates of severe injuries. Despite summertime peaks in SIRs, there were not significant differences between seasons when examining SIRs by industry (p = 0.9763) or various injury factors. 1,846 of the SIRs were heat-related, and Utilities had the highest rate of heat-related severe injuries (13.34 per 100,000 workers). There was a statistically significant difference in the average injury rate when comparing pre- and post-COVID-19 periods (p {\textless} 0.001), which was statistically similar across all industries (p = 0.8143). Conclusions: Although several prior studies have examined the OSHA SIR data, this is the first known analysis of SIRs in relation to state- and industry-specific employment data. Despite the lack of a significant seasonality in SIRs, many industries seem to be impacted by heat-related injuries across all states. The number and rate of SIRs declined during COVID-19 similarly across all industries, with some industries maintaining low injury reporting rates through 2022. Practical Application: Findings of which industries and states may be experiencing a disproportionate burden of SIRs, including heat-related injuries, can inform injury prevention efforts. Additional work is needed to disentangle the drivers behind decreases in reported severe injuries during the COVID-19 pandemic.},

Recent advances have developed various predictions with different method streams yet it is unclear what are the similarities and differences of these streams and how they suit the accident analyses in reality. This study develops time-series accident rate predictions at urban intersections to examine the performance of three streams of the models including statistical model (Negative Binomial Model), machine learning techniques (SARIMA-X) and neural network algorithms (Multi Layer Perceptron, MLP) and further analyzes the suitability of the three streams. Pearson correlation and statistical analysis are first performed to identify the relationships among the spatial-temporal variables (e.g., number of lanes). It is found that the Negative Binomial Model performs superior for the average accuracy of the accident predictions. SARIMA-X performs better for study areas with similar magnitudes of historical traffic accidents over time while MLP is more suitable for accident datasets exhibiting varied magnitudes of accident events. The results provide references and practical insights into the potential of leveraging advanced algorithms and techniques to tackle the dynamics of traffic accidents and improve road safety.},

To that aim, a database containing road collisions, fatalities, and slight injuries data from Greece were derived from the Hellenic Statistical Authority (HSA) and covered a ten-year timeframe (from January 2010 to August 2020. The chosen time period contained normal operations, as well as the period of the first COVID-19-induced lockdown period in Greece. Three different Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) time series models were implemented in order to compare the observed measurements to forecasted values that were intended to depict assumed conditions; namely, without the appearance of the COVID-19 pandemic. Modelling results revealed that the total number of road collisions, fatalities, and slightly injured were decreased, mainly due to the sharp traffic volume decrease. However, the percentage reduction of the collision variables and traffic volume were found to be disproportionate, which probably indicates that more collisions occurred with regard to the prevailing traffic volume. An additional finding is that fatalities and slightly injured rates were significantly increased during the lockdown period and the subsequent month. Overall, it can be concluded that a worse performance was identified in terms of road safety. Since subsequent waves of COVID-19 cases and other pandemics may reappear in the future, the outcomes of the current study may be exploited for the improvement of road safety from local authorities and policymakers.},

	abstract = {Ridge regression, a classic machine learning algorithm, is widely used in various time series forecasting tasks due to its simplicity and rational modeling mechanism. However, its inherent structural simplicity limits its ability to effectively model time series with a fixed period. To improve this situation, the concepts of the cross-period accumulation and self-estimated seasonal indices are introduced. Specifically, the existing efficient accumulation operations are utilized to perform cross-period accumulation on the time series to improve the modeling diversity. Following this, seasonal indices are embedded into the model structure and treated as parameters to be estimated directly from the data. This approach equips the model with the ability to identify and capture periodicity autonomously, without relying on manually predefined indices. To further improve the model’s generalization ability and forecasting accuracy, two optimization methods are employed: the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and grid search. The combination of these methods ensures robust hyperparameter tuning and promotes model stability across different forecasting scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms competing models in terms of MAPE, MSE, and MAE on the monthly Total Renewable Energy Consumption (TREC) dataset from the United States and the quarterly GDP dataset from China. Notably, the proposed model achieves MAPE values of 0.7443\% and 1.4290\% on these datasets, respectively, validating its effectiveness.},

However, significant challenges persist in aligning these tools with practical safety needs, including accurate risk assessment, incident prediction, and targeted prevention strategies. While prior reviews focused narrowly on specific industries or data types, this study presents a comprehensive analysis of ML models in accident analysis, categorizing them by accident type, industry application, and modeling methodology. This study addresses critical challenges in ML model development—such as data quality, hyperparameter tuning, and managing class imbalances—and examines less-discussed topics, including explanatory variable selection and strategies for mitigating overfitting. This review thoroughly assesses the current state of ML-based accident prediction, highlighting critical gaps, methodological limitations, and potential research directions. By analyzing 504 studies across three perspectives—Accident Type, Industry Application, and Modeling Methodology—this review identifies pressing challenges, including (1) limitations in data quality and availability, especially for real-time sources; (2) inadequate model interpretability across applications; (3) difficulties in handling imbalanced accident datasets; and (4) the lack of an integrated framework for incorporating proactive data and industry-specific risk factors. The findings outline a roadmap for advancing ML in occupational safety by enhancing model robustness, improving interpretability, and expanding data sources. This review aims to better align ML applications with safety objectives, promoting data-driven approaches for effective accident analysis and prevention across industries.},

	abstract = {When a forecast of the total value over several time periods ahead is required, forecasters are presented with two temporal aggregation (TA) approaches to produce required forecasts: i) aggregated forecast (AF) or ii) aggregate data using non-overlapping temporal aggregation (AD). Often, the recommendation is to aggregate data to a frequency relevant to the decision the eventual forecast will support and then produce the forecast. However, this might not be always the best choice and we argue that both AF and AD approaches may outperform each other in different situations. Moreover, there is a lack of evidence on what indicators may determine the superiority of each approach. We design and execute an empirical experiment framework to first explore the performance of these approaches using monthly time series of M4 competition dataset. We further turn the problem into a classification supervised learning by constructing a database consisting of features of each time series as predictor and model class labelled as AF/AD as response/outcome. We then build machine learning algorithms to investigate the association between time series features and the performance of AF and AD. Our findings suggest that both AF and AD approaches may not consistently generate accurate results for every individual series. AF is shown to be significantly better than AD for the monthly M4 time series, especially for longer horizons. We build several machine learning approaches using a set of extracted time series features as input to predict accurately whether AD or AF should be used. We find out that Random Forest (RF) is the most accurate approach in correctly classifying the outcome assessed both by statistical measures such as misclassification error, F-statistics, area under the curve, and a utility measure. The RF approach reveals that curvature, nonlinearity, seas\_pacf, unitroot\_pp, mean, ARCHM.LM, Coefficient of Variation, stability, linearity, and max\_level\_shif are among the most important features in driving the predictions of the model. Our findings indicate that the strength of trend, ARCH.LM, hurst, autocorrelation lag 1, unitroot\_pp, and seas\_pacf may favour AF approach, while lumpiness, entropy, nonlinearity, curvature, and strength of seasonality may increase the chance of AD performing better.

	abstract = {Background
Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) has become an area of increasing concern for organizations and institutions. As it evolves, it has gradually posed ongoing challenges, becoming more complex, for organizations. Consequently, more comprehensive studies are required to advance academic and institutional research. From this perspective, this study aims to gather research contributions on the effectiveness of existing interventions for OSH improvement and identify areas for further exploration.

Methods
According to the nature of scientific literature, the overall process of a literature review was investigated following an integrative approach, which involved searching for, selecting, and analyzing various literature in a creative and integrated manner, without a predefined structure.

Results
The analysis suggests that there is room for improvement in understanding the effectiveness of OSH interventions and more concrete guidance is still desirable. Based on the literature, some research areas for future developments in OSH interventions are identified. One potential area to explore further is fostering human-centered technological development and a more conscious network of stakeholders, with higher coordination, shared knowledge, and open communication.

Implications
Focusing on the proposed directions will support scholars and practitioners in pursuing continuous OSH improvement through more effective and well-grounded workplace interventions and encourage organizations to be proactive in daily OSH management.},

	abstract = {Purpose:
The construction industry is a diverse sector with exposure to multiple psychosocial and environmental workplace hazards that increase the risk of injury. This scoping review aims to consolidate the existing literature on the physical and psychosocial determinants influencing the risk of occupational physical injuries among construction workers globally.

Methods:
A scoping review was conducted using the PRISMA extension checklist guided. Literature searches were performed between June and October 2023 in electronic academic databases.

Results:
A total of 77 studies were identified, encompassing various geographical regions, including North America (n = 29), Africa (n = 18), Europe (n = 12), Asia (n = 9), the Middle East (n = 5), and Oceania (n = 4). The review identified physical and psychosocial factors in 3 domains influencing occupational physical injuries: workplace physical environment (eg, exposure to physical hazards, availability and utilization of personal protective equipment, company size, and job type), workplace culture (eg, psychosocial stressors, gender-related barriers, migrant and ethnic disparities, educational background), and physical wellbeing, health and aging (eg, age, obesity, sleep quality, marital stats, and physical health status). Notably, workers from social minority groups (eg, women, ethnic and migrant workers) of young ({\textless}25 years old) or older ages (45-55 years old) employed in smaller construction companies are vulnerable to increased injury risk and exposure to physical and psychosocial hazards in the workplace.

Conclusion:
The review emphasizes a global paucity of research examining the implications of physical and psychosocial factors on injury risk within the construction industry. Future research should prioritize investigating the impact of psychosocial hazards on younger and older workers to detect age-related differences in injury rate, treatment access, and work-related health outcomes.},

	abstract = {This article introduces the special issue, bringing together research on psychosocial workplace hazards (PSWH) which engages industrial relations (IR) perspectives. This is important as PSWH are increasingly studied and regulated, with new regulatory frameworks creating opportunity and necessity for IR perspectives to engage with PSWH. These hazards are intimately related to power relations between employers, workers and the broader society within which they interact, a topic of longstanding investigation within IR. To date, PSWH research has largely occurred in the work, health and safety (WHS) field, reflecting a broader historical separation between WHS and IR in scholarship and practice. While WHS literature outlines the significance of psychosocial hazards as a public health issue, and proposes solutions for their mitigation, we argue that IR framing, and indeed IR frames of reference, can better explain the existence and promote mitigation of PSWH. In this SI the seven papers provide insights into the history of PSWH study; impact of work conditions on restructuring and PSWH; applying the Pressure, Disorganisation and Regulatory Failure (PDR) model in research on sexual harassment; organisational conditions that contribute to the health risks associated with the work, psychosocial hazards women workers experience due to menstruation in developing countries and union strategies for managing workload of union employees.},

Yet, scant evidence is available about their relative performance in terms of accuracy and computational requirements. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate such performance across multiple forecasting horizons using a large subset of 1045 monthly time series used in the M3 Competition. After comparing the post-sample accuracy of popular ML methods with that of eight traditional statistical ones, we found that the former are dominated across both accuracy measures used and for all forecasting horizons examined. Moreover, we observed that their computational requirements are considerably greater than those of statistical methods. The paper discusses the results, explains why the accuracy of ML models is below that of statistical ones and proposes some possible ways forward. The empirical results found in our research stress the need for objective and unbiased ways to test the performance of forecasting methods that can be achieved through sizable and open competitions allowing meaningful comparisons and definite conclusions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study introduced a novel approach for predicting occupational injury severity by leveraging deep learning-based text classification techniques to analyze unstructured narratives. Unlike conventional methods that rely on structured data, our approach recognizes the richness of information within injury narrative descriptions with the aim of extracting valuable insights for improved occupational injury severity assessment.
METHODS: Natural language processing (NLP) techniques were harnessed to preprocess the occupational injury narratives obtained from the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) from January 2015 to June 2023. The methodology involved meticulous preprocessing of textual narratives to standardize text and eliminate noise, followed by the innovative integration of Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Global Vector (GloVe) word embeddings for effective text representation. The proposed predictive model adopts a novel Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) architecture and is further refined through model optimization, including random search hyperparameters and in-depth feature importance analysis. The optimized Bi-LSTM model has been compared and validated against other machine learning classifiers which are naïve Bayes, support vector machine, random forest, decision trees, and K-nearest neighbor.
RESULTS: The proposed optimized Bi-LSTM models' superior predictability, boasted an accuracy of 0.95 for hospitalization and 0.98 for amputation cases with faster model processing times. Interestingly, the feature importance analysis revealed predictive keywords related to the causal factors of occupational injuries thereby providing valuable insights to enhance model interpretability.
CONCLUSION: Our proposed optimized Bi-LSTM model offers safety and health practitioners an effective tool to empower workplace safety proactive measures, thereby contributing to business productivity and sustainability. This study lays the foundation for further exploration of predictive analytics in the occupational safety and health domain.},

We propose a new estimator, iterated OLS (iOLS), which targets the normalized average treatment effect, preserving the percentage-change interpretation while addressing these limitations. Our procedure is the theoretically justified analogue of the ad-hoc log(1+Y) transformation and delivers a consistent and asymptotically normal estimator of the parameters of the exponential conditional mean model. iOLS is computationally efficient, globally convergent, and free of the incidental-parameter bias, while extending naturally to endogenous regressors through iterated 2SLS. We illustrate the methods with simulations and revisit three influential publications.},

This study explores the influence of distinct information utilisation on the accuracy of hierarchical forecasts, proposing and evaluating locals and a range of Global Forecasting Models (GFMs). In contrast to local models, which forecast each series independently, we develop GFMs to exploit cross-series and cross-hierarchies information, improving both forecasting performance and computational efficiency. We employ reconciliation methods to ensure coherency in forecasts and use the Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE) and Multiple Comparisons with the Best (MCB) tests to assess statistical significance. The findings indicate that GFMs possess significant advantages for hierarchical forecasting, providing more accurate and computationally efficient solutions across different levels in a hierarchy. Two specific GFMs based on LightGBM are introduced, demonstrating superior accuracy and lower model complexity than their counterpart local models and conventional methods such as Exponential Smoothing (ES) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA).},

Results suggest that the strongest representatives of the time series methods (ARIMA, Theta) exhibit high accuracies, but certain regression methods (Huber, Extra Trees, Random Forest, Light Gradient Boosting Machines, Gradient Boosting Machines, Ridge, Bayesian Ridge) deliver even more promising results for all forecasting horizons. Finally, depending on the specific use case, the suitable method should be employed, as certain methods are more appropriate for different frequencies and some have an advantageous trade-off between computational time and performance.},

	abstract = {Background
Accurate patient-specific predictions on return-to-work after traumatic brain injury (TBI) can support both clinical practice and policymaking. The use of machine learning on large administrative data provides interesting opportunities to create such prognostic models.
Aim
The current study assesses whether return-to-work one year after TBI can be predicted accurately from administrative data. Additionally, this study explores how model performance and feature importance change depending on whether a distinction is made between mild and moderate-to-severe TBI.
Methods
This study used a population-based dataset that combined discharge, claims and social security data of patients hospitalized with a TBI in Belgium during the year 2016. The prediction of TBI was attempted with three algorithms, elastic net logistic regression, random forest and gradient boosting and compared in their performance by their accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver operator curve (ROC AUC).
Results
The distinct modelling algorithms resulted in similar results, with 83\% accuracy (ROC AUC 85\%) for a binary classification of employed vs. not employed and up to 76\% (ROC AUC 82\%) for a multiclass operationalization of employment outcome. Modelling mild and moderate-to-severe TBI separately did not result in considerable differences in model performance and feature importance. The features of main importance for return-to-work prediction were related to pre-injury employment.
Discussion
While clearly offering some information beneficial for predicting return-to-work, administrative data needs to be supplemented with additional information to allow further improvement of patient-specific prognose.},

	abstract = {Objective
We aimed to explore the added value of common machine learning (ML) algorithms for prediction of outcome for moderate and severe traumatic brain injury.
Study Design and Setting
We performed logistic regression (LR), lasso regression, and ridge regression with key baseline predictors in the IMPACT-II database (15 studies, n = 11,022). ML algorithms included support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting machines, and artificial neural networks and were trained using the same predictors. To assess generalizability of predictions, we performed internal, internal-external, and external validation on the recent CENTER-TBI study (patients with Glasgow Coma Scale {\textless}13, n = 1,554). Both calibration (calibration slope/intercept) and discrimination (area under the curve) was quantified.
Results
In the IMPACT-II database, 3,332/11,022 (30\%) died and 5,233(48\%) had unfavorable outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale less than 4). In the CENTER-TBI study, 348/1,554(29\%) died and 651(54\%) had unfavorable outcome. Discrimination and calibration varied widely between the studies and less so between the studied algorithms. The mean area under the curve was 0.82 for mortality and 0.77 for unfavorable outcomes in the CENTER-TBI study.
Conclusion
ML algorithms may not outperform traditional regression approaches in a low-dimensional setting for outcome prediction after moderate or severe traumatic brain injury. Similar to regression-based prediction models, ML algorithms should be rigorously validated to ensure applicability to new populations.},

The ARIMA and state space models were used for the predictions on the first-level model ensemble. On the second level, the time series predictions of these models were combined for stacking, using panel data estimators as a cross-learner and also exploiting the strong hierarchical data structure (time series nested in occupational groups). Very few methods adopt stacking to generate ensembles for time series regressions. Indeed, to the best of our knowledge, panel data modeling has never before been used as a cross-learner in staking strategies. Empirical application was used to fit employment by occupations in 30 European countries between 2010 Q1 and 2022 Q4, using the last year as the test set. The empirical results show that using panel data modeling as a multivariate time series cross-learner that stacks univariate time series base models—especially when they do not produce accurate predictions—is an alternative worthy of consideration, also with respect to such classical aggregation schemes as optimal and equal weighting.},

	abstract = {Objective
We aimed to explore the added value of common machine learning (ML) algorithms for prediction of outcome for moderate and severe traumatic brain injury.
Study Design and Setting
We performed logistic regression (LR), lasso regression, and ridge regression with key baseline predictors in the IMPACT-II database (15 studies, n = 11,022). ML algorithms included support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting machines, and artificial neural networks and were trained using the same predictors. To assess generalizability of predictions, we performed internal, internal-external, and external validation on the recent CENTER-TBI study (patients with Glasgow Coma Scale {\textless}13, n = 1,554). Both calibration (calibration slope/intercept) and discrimination (area under the curve) was quantified.
Results
In the IMPACT-II database, 3,332/11,022 (30\%) died and 5,233(48\%) had unfavorable outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale less than 4). In the CENTER-TBI study, 348/1,554(29\%) died and 651(54\%) had unfavorable outcome. Discrimination and calibration varied widely between the studies and less so between the studied algorithms. The mean area under the curve was 0.82 for mortality and 0.77 for unfavorable outcomes in the CENTER-TBI study.
Conclusion
ML algorithms may not outperform traditional regression approaches in a low-dimensional setting for outcome prediction after moderate or severe traumatic brain injury. Similar to regression-based prediction models, ML algorithms should be rigorously validated to ensure applicability to new populations.},

However, the limited volume and lack of diversity in existing construction safety datasets pose significant challenges to conducting in-depth analyses. To address this research gap, this paper introduces the Construction Safety Dataset (CSDataset), a well-organized comprehensive multi-level dataset that encompasses incidents, inspections, and violations recorded sourced from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). This dataset uniquely integrates structured attributes with unstructured narratives, facilitating a wide range of approaches driven by machine learning and large language models. We also conduct a preliminary approach benchmarking and various cross-level analyses using our dataset, offering insights to inform and enhance future efforts in construction safety. For example, we found that complaint-driven inspections were associated with a 17.3\% reduction in the likelihood of subsequent incidents. Our dataset and code are released at https://github.com/zhenhuiou/Construction-Safety-Dataset-CSDataset.},

In this paper we study the application of these methods to time series forecasting tasks. For independent and identically distributed data the most common approach is cross-validation. However, the dependency among observations in time series raises some caveats about the most appropriate way to estimate performance in this type of data. Currently, there is no consensual approach. We contribute to the literature by presenting an extensive empirical study which compares different performance estimation methods for time series forecasting tasks. These methods include variants of cross-validation, out-of-sample (holdout), and prequential approaches. Two case studies are analysed: One with 174 real-world time series and another with three synthetic time series. Results show noticeable differences in the performance estimation methods in the two scenarios. In particular, empirical experiments suggest that blocked cross-validation can be applied to stationary time series. However, when the time series are non-stationary, the most accurate estimates are produced by out-of-sample methods, particularly the holdout approach repeated in multiple testing periods.},

In this paper, we propose model class reliance (MCR) as the range of VI values across all well-performing model in a prespecified class. Thus, MCR gives a more comprehensive description of importance by accounting for the fact that many prediction models, possibly of different parametric forms, may fit the data well. In the process of deriving MCR, we show several informative results for permutation-based VI estimates, based on the VI measures used in Random Forests. Specifically, we derive connections between permutation importance estimates for a single prediction model, U-statistics, conditional variable importance, conditional causal effects, and linear model coefficients. We then give probabilistic bounds for MCR, using a novel, generalizable technique. We apply MCR to a public data set of Broward County criminal records to study the reliance of recidivism prediction models on sex and race. In this application, MCR can be used to help inform VI for unknown, proprietary models.},

	abstract = {Due to the development of next-generation sequencing technology and an increased appreciation of their role in modulating host immunity and their potential as therapeutic agents, the human microbiome has emerged as a key area of interest in various biological investigations of human health and disease. However, microbiome data present a number of statistical challenges not addressed by existing methods, such as the varying sequencing depth, the compositionality, and zero inflation. Solutions like scaling and transformation methods help to mitigate heterogeneity and release constraints, but often introduce biases and yield inconsistent results on the same data. To address these issues, we conduct a systematic review of compositional data transformation, with a particular focus on the connection and distinction of existing techniques. Additionally, we create a new framework that enables the development of new transformations by combining proportion conversion with contrast transformations. This framework includes well-known methods such as Additive Log Ratio (ALR) and Centered Log Ratio (CLR) as special cases. Using this framework, we develop two novel transformations—Centered Arcsine Contrast (CAC) and Additive Arcsine Contrast (AAC)—which show enhanced performance in scenarios with high zero-inflation. Moreover, our findings suggest that ALR and CLR transformations are more effective when zero values are less prevalent. This comprehensive review and the innovative framework provide microbiome researchers with a significant direction to enhance data transformation procedures and improve analytical outcomes.},

	abstract = {Large collections of time series often have aggregation constraints due to product or geographical groupings. The forecasts for the most disaggregated series are usually required to add-up exactly to the forecasts of the aggregated series, a constraint we refer to as “coherence.” Forecast reconciliation is the process of adjusting forecasts to make them coherent. The reconciliation algorithm proposed by Hyndman et al. (2011) is based on a generalized least squares estimator that requires an estimate of the covariance matrix of the coherency errors (i.e., the errors that arise due to incoherence). We show that this matrix is impossible to estimate in practice due to identifiability conditions. We propose a new forecast reconciliation approach that incorporates the information from a full covariance matrix of forecast errors in obtaining a set of coherent forecasts. Our approach minimizes the mean squared error of the coherent forecasts across the entire collection of time series under the assumption of unbiasedness. The minimization problem has a closed-form solution. We make this solution scalable by providing a computationally efficient representation. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method compared to alternative methods using a series of simulation designs which take into account various features of the collected time series. This is followed by an empirical application using Australian domestic tourism data. The results indicate that the proposed method works well with artificial and real data.
